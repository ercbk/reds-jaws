Reds JAWS
================

The purpose of this [dashboard](https://erbo.shinyapps.io/jaws4/) is to
provide tools to evaluate nominees for the Reds Hall of Fame. Its
primary feature is the JAWS-4 statistic. JAWS-4 is a version of Jay
Jaffe’s JAWS statistic that’s been modified to apply to a franchise’s
Hall of Fame.

The JAWS statistic is meant to be a starting point in the discussion of
a nominee’s creditials for the Hall of Fame. Jaffe provides a thorough
explanation
[here](https://www.si.com/mlb/2017/11/27/hall-fame-jaws-intro-2018-ballot).
There’s also a more succinct description at
[Baseball-Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/jaws.shtml).

Other features include a Hall of Fame score which relates a player’s
statistics to a typical member of the Hall of Fame and player stat ranks
and percentiles. Lastly, there are multiple tables to compare players in
other categories like the postseason, fielding, and awards.

A user guide for the dashboard can be found
